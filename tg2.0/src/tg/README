This README is intended to be read by experimenters who would like to
modify the code to suit their own experimental
setup. 

1. Compilation. First download the TG 2.0 source distribution
<source link>. Executing

       $gzip -d -c tg2.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
or
       $zcat tg2.0.tar.Z | tar  -xvf -
or
       $tar -xvf tg2.0.tar 

will create the tg and dcat subdirectories in tg2.0/src. Executing
gmake in the tg and dcat directories will generate the
executables. Executing "gmake clean" will remove the all non-essential
files created during compilation.

TG should compile on most Unix -based platforms. Care has been taken
to keep it as portable as possible and to avoid platform specific
code. Minor modifications may be required in some cases. Lex or flex
and Yacc are required for compilation, and should be used with
backward compatbility enabled. The optional post processing script,
gengraph.pl, requires perl.

If you choose to modify the directory structure of the distribution,
there is a path dependency between the tg and dcat directories. There is
a symbolic link betwen a source file in the tg and dcat directories. The 
makefile in the dcat directory has the tg directory in its include path.

Installation.Executing

      $gmake install

on the command line in the individual directories of tg and dcat will
compile the source, if necessary and install tg in appropriate platform 
dependent bin subdirectory. For example "gmake install" in the tg directory on 
a Linux platform will first generate a tg binary, and then copy it to
the "../bin/linux/" directory.

2. LEX/FLEX: There are subtle differences between lex and flex on the
various platform. Enable "-l" option with flex to ensure full
compatability.
