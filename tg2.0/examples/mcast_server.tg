# This script instructs TG to execute in the server or the sink mode 
# in which it only receives packets and records the information in the 
# binary log file. TG is initialized at time 15 secs from the start, and 
# starting at 1.1 secs after initialization it waits for clients to 
# send data. The 239.192.0.1 multicast address specification allows TG to 
# receive multicast packets as well.
