# Type of Service/QOS field depends on the OS support for setting
# the TOS field in the IP header as specified in the RFC 791.
#(e.g., # SunOS 4.4.1 does not support setting TOS field). A subset 
# of the bits from the original TOS field are currently used for 
# supporting Differentiated Services. See RFC 2474
